Another random portfolio site but this time in ♾*DevOps*♾ flavour.

I understand position which for some doesn't exit but somehow is existing as tools, practices, mindset etc. to achieve ultimate goal which is to deliver faster and better software to production. Thats my understanding for what purpose DevOps position exist.

In technical terms: I host this site on small vps with <span style="color:  #DD1155;">Debian 10</span> and managing <span style="color:  #2496ED
;">containers</span> workload with <span style="color: #60DEA9;">Nomad</span> from Hashicorp. <span style="color: #1F76AC;">Haproxy</span> as reverse proxy to custom <span style="color: #009639;">nginx</span> container and <span style="color: #F38533;">promtail</span> to send logs from edge to <span style="color: #F38533;">Grafana Cloud</span>.
